Integral approximation with Monte Carlo (MC) methods.  

**main_1.m:** Estimate the mean, variance and kurtosis of standard normal distribution. Both estimates and variances are plotted as functions of the sample size.  
**main_2.m:** Estimate P(X<1), X~Exp(1). Two different MC estimators (i.e. sample densities) are adopted. Estimates versus sample sizes is plotted.  
**main_3.m:** Estimate a bi-variate integral with conditioning, which reduces the variance of MC estimator.  
**main_1.py:** Same as main_1.m.  
**main_2.py:** Same as main_2.m.  
**main_3.py:** Same as main_3.m.
