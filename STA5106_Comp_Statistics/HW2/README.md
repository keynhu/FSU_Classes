Solve linear regression by 1) First Householder Transformation; 2) Then Back-Substitution.  

**house.m:** Function. Compute Householder vector for the input vector.  
**rowhouse.m:** Function. Compute first-column-Householder-transformed matrix for the input matrix.  
**householder.m:** Function. Compute first-column-Householder-transformed matrix for the input matrix.  
**backsub.m:** Function. Use back-substitution to solve y=Xb, where X is an upper-triangular matrix.  
**functions.py:** All functions above, written in Python.
