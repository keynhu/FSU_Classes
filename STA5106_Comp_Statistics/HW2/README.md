Solve linear regression by 1) Householder Transformation; 2) Then Back-Substitution.  

house.m: Input vector x, output Householder vector v.  
rowhouse.m: Input matrix X, output first-column Householder-transformed matrix X_new.  
householder.m: Input matrix X, output Householder-transformed matrix X_new.  
backsub.m: Input upper-trg matrix X and vector y, output b, solution to y=Xb.  
functions.py: All functions above, written in Python.
