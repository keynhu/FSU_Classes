Implement K-means algorithm on several datasets.

**main.m:** Implement K-means on four datasets: Two from HW6 and two from HW7.  
**kmeans.m:** Function. Do K-means clustering, given data and a specific K. Return clustered labels and SSE evolution sequence.  
**kmeansplot.m:** Draw scatter plot of data according to clustered labels. Also draw the evolution of SSE (Sum of Squared Error).  
**kmeans.py:** Same as kmeans.m and kmeansplot.m. (Note: it reads .mat file with scipy.io.)
