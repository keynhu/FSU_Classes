Implement K-means algorithm on several datasets.

main.m: Use the following two functions to implement K-means on four datasets. Two from HW6 and two from this HW.  
kmeans.m: Do K-means clustering, given data and a specific $K$. Return clustered labels and SSE evolution sequence.  
kmeansplot.m: Draw the scatter plot of data according to clustered labels. Also draw the evolution of SSE (Sum of Squared Error).  
kmeans.py: Same as kmeans.m and kmeansplot.m. Note it reads .mat file with scipy.io.
