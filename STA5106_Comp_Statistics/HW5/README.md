Solve the root-finding problem with Simple Iteration, and Newton-Raphson Method.  

**newton.m**: Function. Newton-Raphson method, given f(x), f'(x), x0 (initial point), eps (threshold).  
**simple_iter.m**: Function. Simple iteration method, given f(x), x0 (initial point), eps (threshold).  
**iter_plot.m**: Function. Draw the SSE evolution of two methods, and plot them directly with original function plot.  
**multiplicity.m**: Compute the ratios between every two absolute errors E_i, E_{i-1}, with which we can find the multiplicity of a root.  
**problem5_3_c.m**: Find the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of $\theta$, given the parametrized PDF and n observations.  
**iter_plot.py**: Same as newton.m, simple_iter.m and iter_plot.m.  
**multiplicity.py**: Same as multiplicity.m.
