Use two methods to solve for the root-finding problem.  

newton.m: Newton-Raphson method, given f(x), f'(x), x0 (initial point), eps (threshold).  
simple_iter.m: Simple iteration method, given f(x), x0 (initial point), eps (threshold).  
iter_plot.m: Draw the SSE evolution of two methods, and plot them directly with original function plot.  
multiplicity.m: Compute the ratios between every two absolute errors E_i, E_{i-1}, with which we can find the multiplicity of a root.  
problem5_3_c.m: Find the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of $\theta$, given the parametrized PDF and n observations.  
iter_plot.py: Same as newton.m, simple_iter.m and iter_plot.m.  
multiplicity.py: Same as multiplicity.m.
